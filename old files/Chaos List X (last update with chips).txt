In the 1990s someone introduced my to a really cool Magic variant called Chaos Magic. One day I couldn't find the list and didn't have internet access, so I started my own list. Over the years I kept adding to it, with the help of Rahul Chandra, until it became the endless document you see spreading out below this paragraph. I'm not sure who had the original idea for Chaos, as I've seen numerous variants circulating on the internet. The creators used to have a web site, but I can't find it today. Whoever you are, it was a really good idea.

-------------------
COMPREHENSIVE RULES
-------------------

(Note: Over the years we've needed to create a lot of rules to deal with unusual situations in Chaos Magic. This process has cumulated in the following "comprehensive rules" modeled after the MtG document of the same name. You don't need to understand these rules to enjoy Chaos Magic, but they should be useful when you want precise answers.)

An EnchantGame is an enchantment token with supertype "EnchantGame." It does not enter the battlefield under any player's control, but all players are affected by its text box as though they controlled it. At the beginning of the game, once all players have drawn their hands and used the abilities of cards that allow them to start the game with those cards on the battlefield, the active player rolls on {EnchantGame}. If there is no EnchantGame permanent on the battlefield at the beginning of a player's upkeep, that player rolls on {EnchantGame}. If a player would roll an EnchantGame, first exile all EnchantGame permanents.

There is a new step that takes place between your upkeep and draw steps called the chaos step. Immediately after a player's chaos step begins, as a turn-based action, that player rolls on one of the Chaos Lists. There are 6 Chaos Lists lettered A through F. The first chaos roll of the game is made on Chaos List C. Subsequent chaos rolls are made on the last Chaos List that was rolled on. The result of a roll is called a chaos ability, and goes on the stack. It can then be responded to like any other object that could go on the stack. The controller of the chaos ability is the player who rolled it. If the roll asks you to roll dice, do so before choosing targets.

The six Chaos Lists are followed by other lists. When an ability directs you to "roll on {name of list}", then as part of the resolution of that ability, find the list below called "name of list", and follow the directions appearing at the beginning of that list. If an ability directs you to roll multiple times on a list, then put a chaos ability onto the stack for each roll that reads: "Roll on {that list}". If the ability directs you to roll multiple times on different lists, put the chaos abilities onto the stack in such an order as will result in the chaos abilities resolving in the order specified by the ability that put them onto the stack. If an ability directs you to "roll Chaos n times", place n chaos abilities on the stack that read: "Make a chaos roll on the last Chaos List that was rolled on." Note that some lists are called "charts".

There is a new zone, called the middle world. Cards in the middle world are placed face up in the centre of the play area. Once per turn, a player may play a card in the middle world.

When the title of a roll is in brackets, the chaos ability has the text and characteristics of the Magic card of that name. Choose targets and modes normally, but ignore any costs. [Title] x n means that you put n such abilities on the stack. When the title appears in braces (e.g. {EnchantGame}), find the appropriate list below and roll the dice indicated.

During the game players will acquire chips. Once per turn, any time you could cast a sorcery, you may try your luck at the {Slot Machine}.
Any time you could cast a sorcery, you may redeem chips at {Prizes}.

If the game breaks up or becomes tedious, roll on {Resolution}.

Some terms are enclosed in angle brackets (e.g. <ante>). These refer to optional gameplay mechanics. If a roll refers to a mechanic you're not using, roll again.

Chaos Magic is more fun if playing with Vanguard cards. If a roll instructs you to gain an ability, add it to your Vanguard card. If you aren't playing with Vanguard cards, just assume each player has a blank Vanguard card that abilities can be added to.

Occasionally a card will become banned due to a Chaos roll. If a banned card is face up in a public zone, remove it from the game as a state-based action. Note that banned cards are not exiled - they are truly removed from the game.

Some rolls cause a player to temporarily leave the game. While that player is gone, he is outside of each other player's range of influence. If at any point there is only one player who has not left the game, the players who have left the game return to the game.

(Optional Rule) If a player tries to leave his chaos step without rolling chaos, he must roll on {NegativeFeedback} and suffer the consequences.

If multiple abilities have triggered since the last time a player received priority, triggered abilities not controlled by any player (i.e. from EnchantGames) are put on the stack last, in an order chosen by the active player.

The first time you would lose the game, roll on {Spite}. The Spite roll goes on the stack like any other effect and that player gets priority. This is problematic given the usual rules because that player is still at 0 life and should die again as a state based effect. There is no easy way around this that will still let players respond to Spite rolls, but we can use the following device: The replacement ability that sends a player to Spite also puts a "death" effect on the stack. That player and any player that would lose while the death effect is on the stack gets "marked" for death. While there is a death effect on the stack no player loses. The death effect resolves as follows: If this is the only death effect on the stack, each player marked for death loses the game. If a spell or ability tries to empty the stack (i.e. Time Stop), resolve all death effects immediately.

Rule 702.23j, "Phased-out tokens cease to exist as a state-based action." is not used in Chaos Magic.
