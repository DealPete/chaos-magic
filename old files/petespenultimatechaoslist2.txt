Peter's Penultimate Chaos List II
=================================


---------------
ACKNOWLEDGEMENT
---------------

This list is a rewrite of a Chaos List found circulating on the internet in the
1990's. The creators used to have a web site at
http://www.planeswalker.com/chaosmagic/, but it appears to be down now. I can
be reached myself at pdeal@nl.rogers.com. I'd so wish to thank Rahul Chandra
for his assistance with this list, and also the countless players who played
Chaos and provided helpful advice. Furthermore, I would like to cast aspersions
upon those who ridiculed me (and continue to do so) for making this list.

-----
RULES
-----

/*The player going first rolls on {EnchantGame}*/. An EnchantGame is a
colourless, costless enchantment token that resides in play under no one's
control. If there is no EnchantGame in play at the beginning of a player's
upkeep, that player rolls on {EnchantGame}.

There is a new step now between your Upkeep and Draw steps called the Chaos
Step. At the beginning of this step, roll on the last Chaos List rolled on.
There are 6 Chaos Lists lettered A through F. The first roll is made on list C.
The roll goes on the stack, so players can respond to it like any other effect.
If an effect asks you to roll dice, do so before choosing targets.

There is a new zone, called the Middle World. Cards in the Middle World are
placed face up in the centre of the play area. Once per turn, a player can play
a card in the Middle World.

When the title of a roll is in brackets, treat it as if you had just cast that
spell, choosing any targets and modes, but ignoring any costs. [Title] x n
means you repeat the roll n times. When the title appears in braces (e.g.
{EnchantGame}), find the appropriate list below and roll.

The first time you would lose the game, you may accuse another player of being
your murderer and roll on {Spite}.

During the game playing will aquire chips. Any time you can play a sorcery, you
may try your luck at the {Slot Machine}, or redeem your chips at {Prizes}.

If the game breaks up or becomes tedious, go to {Resolution}.

Some terms are enclosed in angle brackets (e.g. <ante>). These refer to
optional gameplay mechanics. If a roll refers to a mechanic you're not using,
roll again.

Chaos Magic is more fun if playing with <Vanguard> Avatars.  If a roll
instructs you to gain an ability, add it to your Avatar.  If you aren't playing
with <Vanguard>, just assume each player is starting with a blank Avatar card
that abilities can be added to.

Occasionally a card will become banned due to a Chaos roll (or an
announcement from Wizards of the Coast). When this happens all such cards in
play must be immediately removed from the game. If a banned card ends up in a
player's hand, he removes it from the game and places the top card of his
library into hand. Consider these state based effects.

Some rolls cause a player to be temporarily removed from the game. If you are
the sole player and you would deck out, instead you win the game.

(Optional Rule) If someone forgets to roll on Chaos during their Chaos step
(e.g. someone else reminds them after the Chaos step), then they must roll on
{NegativeFeedback} and suffer the consequences.

There are some more technical rules at the end of the list that should be
useful for sorting out unusual situations (of course in Chaos there's nothing
unusual about an unusual situation).

------
Tokens
------

These tokens are colourless, costless enchantments. The Tokens in braces can be
expended to have various effects anytime you have priority.

|Amulet|
When this token comes into play, roll on Creature Summoning III. During
your upkeep, if there is no creature in play created by this token, roll on
Creature Summoning III.

|Avatar|
At the beginning of any Upkeep Step, active player gains control of Avatar.
X: Choose one: Avatar deals X damage to target player; or target player gains
X life.

|Box|
When this token comes into play, roll on Creature Summoning I. During your
upkeep, if there is no creature in play created by this token, roll on Creature
Summoning I.

|CounterRoll|
Counter a Chaos List Roll.

|Death|
Reduce target player to 0 life.

|Dwelling|
None of you, your hand, graveyard, or library may be targeted by another
player.

|Factory|
When this token comes into play, roll on Creature Summoning V. During your
upkeep, if there is no creature in play created by this token, roll on
Creature Summoning V.

|ForkRoll|
Duplicate a Chaos List Roll. You choose any new targets.

|Joker|
Sacrifice this to roll on the NegativeFeedback Table, or to give control of one
of your permanents to target player.

|Leave Me Alone|
Your spells and permanents can not be targeted by other players.

|Lich|
Go to 0 life. You don't die as a result of being at less than 1 life as long as
this token is in play. Instead of gaining life, draw a card for each point of
life gained. Instead of losing life, sacrifice a permanent in play for each
point of life lost.

|Life|
Return any opponent to starting life if their life total is less.

|Luck of the Irish|
This token allows you to laugh in the face of death. If you would lose the game,
you may instead sacrifice this to have an effect based on your manner of demise:
You have 0 or less life: Return to starting life.
You were forced to draw and had no cards in your library: Shuffle your graveyard
and removed from game piles into your library and draw a card.
You accumulated 10 or more poison counters: Remove the poison counters. All
opponents get 2 poison counters.
The resolution of some lame spell or effect made you lose: You don't lose.
Remove from the game any permanent that generated the effect.
A judge's ruling grants you a game loss: It is overruled. The judge loses a
judging level.
Other unforseen circumstances: You don't lose.

|Maelstrom|
At the end of controller's turn, he passes it to the left or right, randomly
determined. During a player's upkeep, if he controls the Maelstrom Token, he
must either lose 5 life or sacrifice 3 permanents other than this token.

|Mastery|
Sacrifice this to destroy all attacking creatures. Remember, we study the art
so we may never have to use it.

|Nuclear|
Skip all Chaos steps while this is in play. Any permanents that would come into
play go to the graveyard instead. During a player's upkeep he must sacrifice 2
permanents and discard a card of choice from his hand. This token cannot be
sacrificed in this way. When no player controls a permanent other than this,
remove this token from game.

|Object|
When this token comes into play, roll on Creature Summoning II.
During your upkeep, if there is no creature in play created by this token, roll
on Creature Summoning II.

|Phoenix|
Do one of the following:
a) Return to starting life.
b) Lose all poison counters.
c) Shuffle your removed from game pile and your graveyard back into your
library.
d) The next time you would lose, you do not lose.

|Sphere|
When this token comes into play, roll on Creature Summoning IV.
During your upkeep, if there is no creature in play created by this token, roll
on Creature Summoning IV.

|Tyrant|
You may sacrifice a Tyrant token during your upkeep to roll d6, and then
destroy that many permanents. Whenever a tyrant token is destroyed by another
player, he takes 10 damage.

|You Only Live Twice|
Sacrifice this to put a Lich token into play.

Rules Appendix
--------------

Effects from unowned permanents (i.e. EnchantGames) always go on the stack
last.

Rolls on lists actually go on the stack twice: when the roll is first
generated, a "Roll on list X" effect is place on the stack. Its resolution will
be to put a roll from list X on the stack. If a roll asks you to roll multiple
times, each of these roll are placed on the stack individually as "Roll on list
X" effects.

The first time someone would dies, a replacement ability gives him the option
of going to Spite. The Spite roll goes on the stack like any other effect
and that player gets priority. This is problematic given the usual rules
because that player is still at 0 life and should die again as a state based
effect. There is no easy way around this that will still let players respond to
Spite rolls, but we can use the following device: The replacement ability that
sends a player to Spite also puts a "death" effect on the stack. That player
and any player that would lose while the death effect is on the stack gets
"marked" for death. While there is a death effect on the stack no player loses.
The death effect resolves as follows: If this is the only death effect on the
stack, all players marked for death lose the game. If a spell or ability tries
to empty the stack (i.e. Time Stop), resolve all death effects immediately.
